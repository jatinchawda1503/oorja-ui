<p>To standardize texture and flavor, big brands destroy all the natural benefits of your honey by excess filtration and heating.</p>
<p>At <strong>Oorja farms</strong>, we collect nectar from nature and bring it to you in its purest form.
Our honey is harvested sustainably. Our cruelty-free harvesting techniques ensure that honeybees or their hives are not harmed.
